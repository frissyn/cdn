# cdn

A simple and rudimentary CDN written in Ruby with Sinatra.

**Dev Stack--**
+ Server: Sinatra
+ Forms: Sinatra
+ Templates: erb, html
+ Design: Bulma CSS


**Usage Instructions--**

1. `bundle install --clean --path .bundle`
2. `bundle exec ruby main.rb`
3. Enjoy! :)

**NOTE:** Depending on your host programmatic changes to the filesystem won't persist, making this useless. You might need to intgrate a file host system like Cloudinary.
